[02:12:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <9abe, Ethegary Dominion> heyyy
[02:14:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <EthMC, Rogues> In Lil Uzi Vert's song titled "Sanguine Paradise", Uzi clearly states that he grows from 5'4" to 6'6" simply by standing on his money. If you take this into account, he grows 14 inches. Let’s assume that he’s standing on $100 bills. A $100 dollar bill is
[02:15:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <EthMC, Rogues> 0.0043 inches thick, which means an inch of $100 bills is equal to $23,200. Multiply this by the 14 inches he grew and you get $324,800. You can't balance on just one stack of money, so let's assume he's balancing on 6 stacks. Multiply $324,800 by six and
[02:15:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <EthMC, Rogues> and you get $1,948,800. According to Google, Uzi’s net worth is approximately $17,000,000. Take the $1,948,800 that he’s currently standing on and divide that by his net worth of $17,000,000, and you get 0.11463529411, which equals about 11.46%. So, given
[02:15:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <EthMC, Rogues> all this, Lil Uzi Vert is standing on 11.46% of all his money - or $1,948,800 - in Sanguine Paradise.
